## 🛠️ Mock Interview Problems by Week

### Week 21: Foundation Problems

#### Day 1-2: Array Problems
**Problem**: Two Sum Variations
```
Given an array of integers और a target value, 
find all pairs that sum to the target.

Follow-up: What if array is sorted?
Follow-up: What if we need triplets instead?
```

**Solution Approach**:
1. Brute force: O(n²)
2. Hash map: O(n) 
3. Two pointers (if sorted): O(n)

#### Day 3-4: String Problems  
**Problem**: Valid Anagram
```
Given two strings, determine if they are anagrams.
An anagram uses all original letters exactly once.

Example: "listen" और "silent" are anagrams
```

### Week 22: Intermediate Problems

#### Day 1-2: Tree Problems
**Problem**: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
```
Return the level order traversal of binary tree nodes' values.
(i.e., from left to right, level by level)
```

#### Day 3-4: Graph Problems
**Problem**: Number of Islands  
```
Given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water),
count the number of islands.
```

## 🗣️ Communication Templates (Hinglish)

### 1. Problem Understanding
```
"Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly:
- Input format: ___
- Output format: ___  
- Constraints: ___
- Edge cases to consider: ___

Is this understanding correct?"
```

### 2. Approach Discussion
```
"I can think of a few approaches:

Approach 1: [Brute force solution]
- Time complexity: ___
- Space complexity: ___
- Pros: Simple to implement
- Cons: Not optimal

Approach 2: [Optimized solution]  
- Time complexity: ___
- Space complexity: ___
- Pros: More efficient
- Cons: Slightly complex

I think Approach 2 would be better. Should I proceed with that?"
```

### 3. Coding Communication
```
"Let me start coding this solution:

First, I'll handle the edge cases...
Now I'll implement the main logic...
Here I'm using [data structure/algorithm] because...

Does this approach look good so far?"
```

### 4. Testing Communication
```
"Let me test this with a few examples:

Test case 1: [Expected output]
Test case 2: [Edge case]  
Test case 3: [Boundary condition]

The solution handles all cases correctly."
```

## 💡 Common Interview Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Jumping to code immediately** - Always discuss approach first
2. **Not asking questions** - Clarify requirements और constraints  
3. **Ignoring edge cases** - Always consider boundary conditions
4. **Poor time management** - Practice with timer
5. **Not testing solution** - Walk through examples
6. **Getting stuck silently** - Think out loud, ask for hints
7. **Overcomplicating** - Start simple, then optimize
